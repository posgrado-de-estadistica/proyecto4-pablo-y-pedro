abstract = {This chapter discusses dengue, which is a human disease caused by a virus that is transmitted from one person to another by the bite of infected mosquitoes. Dengue fever (DF), DHF, and DSS are caused by four closely related but antigenically distinct single-stranded RNA viruses (DEN 1, 2, 3, and 4) in the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviridae. All four serotypes cause a range of human disease, including asymptomatic infections; undifferentiated fever; classic DF: an acute febrile illness with headache, body aches, and rash; DHF; and DSS. Sequential infections with different serotypes are possible because infection with one serotype provides lifelong protection from a homologous infection but is only briefly cross-protective against heterologous serotypes. Aedes aegypti appears the most important dengue vector. Other mosquitoes in the subgenus Stegomyia, including Aedes albopictus and Ae. polynesiensis, have been implicated as vectors in jungles and rural habitats. Prevention of dengue is presently dependent on control of Ae. aegypti. Although progress is being made developing dengue vaccines and anti-viral drugs, none are licensed and commercially available, and a vaccine will need to be tetravalent to avoid adverse consequences from immune enhancement. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The knowledge of dengue infection associated-risk factors in place, allows that family physician may to design and to perform effective community intervention strategies, since it is from an integral diagnosis which is different in each region. OBJECTIVE: To determine the dengue infection associated-risk factors in San Mateo, Anzo{\'{a}}tegui, Venezuela. METHODS: Universe included 15 000 inhabitants of San Mateo, Libertad municipality, Anzo{\'{a}}tegui in Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela from May, 2007 to May, 2008. A bi-varied analysis was made related to associated risk factors to estimate the relative risk and a multivariate logistic regression analysis to estimate the Odds Ratio value. RESULTS: According the results from the bi-varied and multi-varied analysis of dengue infection risk factors associated with cases of recent infection due to positive M-immunoglobulin dengue and the dengue cases, there was not any study variable, according to proposed hypothesis except that of the low level of knowledge in population on the disease, particularly as regards the symptoms, transmission mechanisms, causal agent and prevention measures. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of dengue in this place is the result of lack of knowledge on disease and the existence of the vector; this latter is the basic condition for its transmission. Its presence is an indirect indicator of the poor hygienic-health conditions of population and also of the existence of the home breeding places.},
